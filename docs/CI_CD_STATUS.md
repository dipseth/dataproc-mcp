## 🔑 **Required Setup Steps**

### **CRITICAL: NPM Token Configuration**

**⚠️ Action Required**: The repository needs an `NPM_TOKEN` secret to publish packages.

#### **Setup Instructions**:

1. **Create NPM Access Token**:
   ```bash
   npm login
   ```
   - Go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) → Account Settings → Access Tokens
   - Generate "Automation" token
   - Copy the token

2. **Add GitHub Secret**:
   - Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - New repository secret: `NPM_TOKEN`
   - Paste your npm token
   - Save

3. **Verify Setup**:
   - Push a commit with conventional format to main branch
   - Watch the release workflow execute
   - Verify package appears on npm registry

## 🎯 **Enhanced Automatic Release Process**

### ✨ **NEW: Automatic PR Merge Publishing**

The CI/CD pipeline now **automatically publishes new versions when PRs are merged to main branch**:

#### **1. Enhanced PR Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/new-feature

# Always run enhanced golden command (now includes release validation)
npm run pre-push

# Use conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: add cluster scaling feature"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feat/new-feature
# Create PR via GitHub UI or CLI
```

#### **2. Automatic Release on PR Merge:**
When a PR is merged to `main`, the enhanced workflow:
- 🔍 **Enhanced commit analysis** - Detects conventional commits in merge
- 📊 **Intelligent version calculation** - Determines appropriate version bump
- 🚀 **Automatic publishing** - Publishes to NPM if changes warrant release
- 📝 **Comprehensive changelog** - Updates with detailed release notes
- ✅ **Post-release validation** - Verifies NPM availability and installation

#### **3. Conventional Commit Examples:**
```bash
# Patch release (bug fixes)
git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication issue"

# Minor release (new features)
git commit -m "feat: add cluster scaling feature"

# Major release (breaking changes)
git commit -m "feat!: redesign API structure

BREAKING CHANGE: API endpoints restructured"

# Performance improvements (patch)
git commit -m "perf: optimize query response time"

# No release (documentation/chores)
git commit -m "docs: update installation guide"
git commit -m "ci: enhance release workflow"
```

#### **4. Enhanced Golden Command:**
```bash
# Now includes release validation
npm run pre-push
# Runs: build + lint + format + type-check + tests + security +
#       package validation + docs + release:dry validation
```

#### **5. Automatic Process Flow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[🔄 PR Merged] --> B[🔍 Enhanced Analysis]
    B --> C[📊 Version Calc]
    C --> D[🚀 Auto Publish]
    D --> E[📝 Release Notes]
    E --> F[✅ Validation]
```

### **Manual Release (Emergency)**
- GitHub Actions → "🚀 Release & Publish" → "Run workflow"
- Select release type or use "auto"
- Enable "dry run" for testing

## 📊 **Version Management**

### **Semantic Versioning Strategy**
| Commit Type | Version Impact | Example |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| `fix:` | PATCH (2.0.1) | Bug fixes |
| `feat:` | MINOR (2.1.0) | New features |
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` | MAJOR (3.0.0) | Breaking changes |
| `perf:` | PATCH (2.0.1) | Performance improvements |
| `docs:`, `style:`, `test:`, `ci:` | No release | Maintenance |

### **Branch Strategy**
- **`main`**: Stable releases (latest tag)
- **`develop`**: Beta releases (beta tag)
- **`release/*`**: Release candidates (rc tag)
