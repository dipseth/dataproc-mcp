# Trigger Documentation Workflow

This file was created to trigger the documentation workflow after updating the Jekyll configuration.

The workflow should now properly process Jekyll files and create the correct permalinks.

- ✅ QUICK_START.md (raw markdown)
- ✅ /QUICK_START/ (Jekyll permalink)

Both should work after this deployment.
