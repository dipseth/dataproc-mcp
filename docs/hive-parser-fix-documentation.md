# Hive Query Results Parser Fix

## Problem Description

The Dataproc server was failing to correctly parse and return structured data from Hive query outputs, particularly when dealing with the specific format of Hive CLI output that includes:
- Connection information at the beginning
- Repeated headers throughout the output
- Special formatting characters and boundaries

## Solution

The issue was fixed by updating the `output-parser.ts` file to better handle the specific format of Hive CLI output:

1. Renamed the `parseHiveCLIOutput` method to `parseHiveOutputToCleanCSV` for better clarity
2. Updated the implementation to:
   - Specifically identify the header at line 5
   - Handle the boundary at line 6
   - Start data extraction from line 7
   - Properly skip repeated headers throughout the file
   - Generate clean CSV output

## Verified Tests

The following tests have been verified to work correctly with the updated parser:

1. `test-job-results-direct.js` - Successfully parses and returns structured data
2. `test-job-results-simple.js` - Correctly integrates with the job results handler
3. `test-direct-parse.js` - Confirms the direct parsing functionality works as expected
4. `test-utils.js` - Verifies that the utility modules in `src/utils` are working correctly

## Unnecessary Test Files

The following test files are no longer needed and can be deleted:

1. `test-clean-csv-parser-v2.js`
2. `test-clean-csv-parser-v3.js`
3. `test-clean-csv-parser.js`
4. `test-job-output-handler.js`
5. `test-job-results.js`
6. `test-local-file.js`
7. `verify-fix.js`
8. `verify-mcp-fix.js`
9. `simple-test.js`

## Utils Functionality

The utility modules in `src/utils` have been verified to be working correctly:

1. `console-interceptor.ts` - Intercepts console logs to ensure they don't interfere with MCP protocol
2. `logger.ts` - Provides logging functionality with different log levels
3. `mcp-stdio-handler.ts` - Ensures only valid JSON is sent to stdout for MCP communication

## Next Steps

1. Delete the unnecessary test files
2. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for edge cases
3. Update any documentation that references the old parser implementation
