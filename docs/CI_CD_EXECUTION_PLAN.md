# CI/CD Execution Plan 🚀

## Feature Branch Strategy for Production Release

This document outlines the step-by-step CI/CD execution plan for the Dataproc MCP Server v1.0.0 production release using a feature branch approach.

## 🎯 Strategy Overview

1. **Create feature branch** for production readiness
2. **Test all GitHub Actions workflows** in isolation
3. **Validate CI/CD pipeline** end-to-end
4. **Merge to main** with squash commit for clean history
5. **Tag and release** v1.0.0 with automated pipeline

## 📋 Step-by-Step Execution

```

### Phase 2: Commit Production Changes

```bash
# Stage all production readiness changes
git add .

# Create comprehensive commit with conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat!: production-ready v1.0.0 with enterprise features
