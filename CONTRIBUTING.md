## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- **main** - Production-ready code
- **develop** - Integration branch for features
- **feature/*** - Feature development branches
- **fix/*** - Bug fix branches
- **release/*** - Release preparation branches

### Workflow Steps

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Develop and Test**
   ```bash
   # Make changes
   npm run build
   npm run test:all-enhanced
   npm run validate
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(scope): add new feature"
   ```

4. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Create PR on GitHub
   ```

5. **Address Review Feedback**
   ```bash
   # Make requested changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix(scope): address review feedback"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Categories

**Unit Tests** (Required for all code changes)
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

```typescript
describe('Schema Validation', () => {
  it('should validate cluster configuration', () => {
    const config = {
      clusterName: 'test-cluster',
      projectId: 'test-project',
      region: 'us-central1'
    };
    
    const result = StartDataprocClusterSchema.safeParse(config);
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

**Integration Test Example:**
```typescript
await runner.runTest('Authentication Test', async () => {
  const result = await validateServiceAccount(mockCredentials);
  assert(result.isValid, 'Service account should be valid');
});
```

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

**JSDoc Comments:**
```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new Dataproc cluster with the specified configuration.
 * 
 * @param config - Cluster configuration object
 * @param options - Additional options for cluster creation
 * @returns Promise that resolves to cluster creation result
 * @throws {ValidationError} When configuration is invalid
 * @throws {AuthenticationError} When credentials are invalid
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await createCluster({
 *   clusterName: 'my-cluster',
 *   projectId: 'my-project',
 *   region: 'us-central1'
 * });
 * ```
